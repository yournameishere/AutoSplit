🏷 App Name & Core Idea

Name: AutoSplit
Tagline: “Payments in. Fair splits out. Automatically.”

Core:
1 wallet / contract per Team/Project →
Whenever someone pays into that team → Massa smart contract instantly and trustlessly splits it between members based on percentages.

No manual calculation. No Excel. No manager needed.

👀 USER POV – How it works for each role
1️⃣ Client (Person who pays the team)

Clients don’t need a full dashboard, just a simple pay page.

Flow:

Client receives a payment link like:
/pay/:teamId or /pay/:invoiceId

They see:

Team name

Description / Invoice reference (“Website redesign”, “YouTube video edit #12”)

Split summary (optional: “This payment will be shared across 4 team members automatically.”)

They:

Enter amount (e.g., 100 MASSA)

Click “Pay with Massa”

Confirm transaction in wallet

What happens behind the scenes:

The smart contract receives 100 MASSA

Immediately (or via ASC loop) splits:

Dev: 50 → address₁

Designer: 20 → address₂

Editor: 20 → address₃

Manager: 10 → address₄

Client is done. No account required.

2️⃣ Team Owner / Admin Dashboard

Route: /dashboard/owner

This is for the person who creates teams & defines splits.

🔹 Owner Main Features

Tabs/routes inside:

/dashboard/owner/overview

/dashboard/owner/teams

/dashboard/owner/team/:teamId

/dashboard/owner/payments

/dashboard/owner/members

/dashboard/owner/proposals (for DAO-like % changes)

/dashboard/owner/settings

a) Create Team / Project

Route: /dashboard/owner/teams/new

Owner fills:

Team / Project name

Description

Default currency (MASSA)

Team avatar/logo

Optional: tags (agency, YouTube, freelance)

Smart contract call:

createTeam(name, metadataURI)


Returns teamId.

Frontend then lets owner add members and share %.

b) Add Members & Set Splits

Still inside /dashboard/owner/team/:teamId/setup:

Form fields:

Member wallet address

Role (designer, dev, editor, etc.)

Percentage (e.g., 20%)

Contract function:

addMember(teamId, memberAddress, percentage, role)


The contract will:

Sum all percentages → must equal 100 (or 10000 for basis points)

Store members in TeamMembers map.

If they want to change later, they don’t directly edit it; they create a proposal (explained below).

c) Generate Payment Link / QR

From /dashboard/owner/team/:teamId:

Show Pay URL: /pay/:teamId

Button: “Copy link” or “Generate QR”

Owners send this to clients.

d) View Payments & Analytics

Route: /dashboard/owner/payments

Shows:

List of all incoming payments:

amount

from address

timestamp

split details

fee cut for team owner (if any)

Each payment is stored in contract as:

Payment {
  id: u64;
  teamId: u64;
  payer: string;
  amount: u64;
  timestamp: u64;
}


Also show:

Total earned per team

Total paid to each member

Graphs (handled in frontend using on-chain data or indexer)

e) Proposals to Change Splits (DAO-style)

Route: /dashboard/owner/proposals

To change percentages fairly (so owner can’t just rug team), we use voting.

Flow:

Owner clicks “Create split change proposal”

Selects team + new percentages

Contract function:

createSplitProposal(teamId, newAllocations[], reason)


Members vote:

voteOnProposal(proposalId, support: bool)


After voting period, ASC executes:

If approved:

applyProposal(proposalId)


Updates team member percentages.

This is where Massa Autonomous Smart Contracts shine:

ASC checks time & executes proposal automatically once voting ends.

3️⃣ Team Member Dashboard

Route: /dashboard/member

This is for normal users (the people getting paid).

🔹 Member Main Features

Tabs/routes:

/dashboard/member/overview – summary across all teams

/dashboard/member/teams – teams they belong to

/dashboard/member/payments – list of what they received

/dashboard/member/proposals – vote on changes

/dashboard/member/settings

a) Overview

Shows:

Total earnings (all time)

Earnings this month

Active teams they’re in

Next expected payment date (comes from ASC if periodic payments exist)

b) Teams

Route: /dashboard/member/teams

Shows list:

Team name

Role

% share in that team

Link to pay page (they can share with clients too)

c) Payments

Route: /dashboard/member/payments

Each row:

Team name

Received amount

Payer (if not private)

Date

Reference (e.g., “Video 7 edit”)

If we use “pull pattern”, they can click Withdraw to move from contract balance → wallet.

d) Proposals & Voting

Route: /dashboard/member/proposals

Members see:

Upcoming or active proposals for their teams

Old/accepted/rejected proposals

They can click:

✅ Approve

❌ Reject

Calls:

voteOnProposal(proposalId, support)


ASC later auto-applies.

🧠 MASSA SMART CONTRACT DESIGN

We’ll split logic into 3 core contracts (or 1 with modules, but logically 3):

TeamRegistry – teams + members + percentages

PaymentSplitter – receives funds & splits payments

Governance – proposals and voting for split changes

And ASC behavior:

Auto-exec proposals after deadline

Auto-generate monthly summaries (optional)

1️⃣ TeamRegistry Contract

Stores:

Team {
  id: u64;
  owner: string;       // creator of the team
  metadataURI: string; // name, description stored in JSON off-chain
  isActive: bool;
}

TeamMember {
  teamId: u64;
  member: string;
  percentage: u16;     // e.g. 2000 = 20.00% if using basis points
  role: string;
}


Key functions:

createTeam(metadataURI: string): u64
addMember(teamId: u64, member: string, percentage: u16, role: string)
removeMember(teamId: u64, member: string)
getTeam(teamId: u64): Team
getMembers(teamId: u64): TeamMember[]


Validation:

Total percentages for a team must always sum to 100% (or 10,000 bp).

2️⃣ PaymentSplitter Contract

Handles actual receipt & distribution of funds.

Core function when client pays:

payTeam(teamId: u64, reference: string) // msg.value = amount


Logic:

Ensure teamId exists & active

Read all TeamMember entries

For each member:

memberShare = amount * percentage / 10000

Option A: send immediately (transfer(member, memberShare))

Option B: add to internal balance:

balances[member] += memberShare;


Store Payment struct for history.

If using internal balances, we expose:

withdrawMyEarnings()
getMyBalance(): u64

3️⃣ Governance Contract (for split changes)

Data:

Proposal {
  id: u64;
  teamId: u64;
  creator: string;
  newAllocations: Allocation[]; // { member, percentage }
  endTime: u64;
  yesVotes: u32;
  noVotes: u32;
  executed: bool;
}

Allocation {
  member: string;
  percentage: u16;
}


Functions:

createSplitProposal(teamId, newAllocations[], reasonURI)
voteOnProposal(proposalId, support)
executeProposal(proposalId) // called by ASC when endTime reached


Who can vote?

Members of that team (including owner)

How ASC fits in:

We schedule an autonomous call that periodically runs:

checkAndExecuteProposals()


This function:

Finds proposals where endTime <= now AND executed == false

If yesVotes > noVotes → updates TeamRegistry percentages

Sets executed = true

No one needs to manually trigger execution → fully autonomous governance.

🔁 AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR (ASC) SUMMARY

Massa’s ASC can:

Regularly scan proposals & auto-execute approved ones.

Auto-generate monthly summary stats:

Total paid per team

Total paid per member
(you can store counters on-chain for quick access)

Optionally, auto-disable inactive teams (no payment in X months).

All of this can be done via scheduled/deferred calls in Massa.

🧱 APP ARCHITECTURE (High-Level)
1. Frontend (DeWeb)

Framework: React / Next.js / Vite + React

Hosted as static files on Massa DeWeb

Interacts with contracts via Massa JS SDK

Main routes:

/ – Landing (What is AutoSplit, CTA: “Create a Team”)

/auth/login – connect wallet, choose role view

/auth/signup – optional extra metadata

/pay/:teamId – client payment page

/dashboard/owner/* – owner dashboard

/dashboard/member/* – member dashboard

2. On-Chain (Massa)

Contracts:

TeamRegistry

PaymentSplitter

Governance

Deployed on Massa buildnet/mainnet depending on hackathon setup.

3. (Optional) Indexer / Backend

Not required for core logic but helpful for:

Fast search and filtering

Analytics charts

Could be:

Simple Node.js server: listens to events/logs, stores them in DB

Frontend fetches from this + on-chain calls for validation

But for hackathon, you can skip this and just read from contracts.

🌊 Complete Flow Summary
When setting up a new team:

Owner connects wallet → /dashboard/owner

Clicks Create Team → createTeam()

Adds members + percentages → addMember()

Team is now ready to receive payments.

Owner copies payment URL /pay/:teamId and shares with client.

When client pays:

Opens /pay/:teamId

Enters amount, pays via Massa

payTeam(teamId) called

Contract splits funds among members according to percentages.

Member dashboards update earnings.

When owner wants to change split:

Goes to /dashboard/owner/proposals

Creates proposal with new percentages → createSplitProposal()

Members visit /dashboard/member/proposals and vote.

ASC later auto-executes:

Checks votes

If approved → updates TeamRegistry members’ percentages.

No one needs to trust the owner—rules are on-chain.
